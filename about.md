Hello! my name is Badreddine Chamkhi, I am a computer science student in ESPRIT Enigneering , Tunisia. I am passionate about cyber security so i pass most of my free time playing CTFs (Capture the flag) with my friends. I mainly do reverse engineering and Binary exploitation. I am conducting this blog to share my writeups of challenges i solved during and after CTFs, also i am going to publish certain studies i do about exploit developpement and other wild discoveries.
